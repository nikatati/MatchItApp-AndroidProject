# MatchItApp-AndroidProject
An application for matching substitutes and teachers who need a substitute teacher.

The idea is a database of substitute teachers - each substitute will have a name, phone number, education details, gender, etc.

The application is intended for educational institutions up to 12th grade.

The application should find a substitute teacher and filter results by class, profession, class type - special education or regular class.

In addition, every substitute teacher who answered the call will get access to the sources of the database of work plans according to core subjects.

Each teacher who opened a request for a substitute teacher in the application receives for each substitute teacher who clicked on the match button an automatic message on WhatsApp and contact information of the substitute teacher.

In this way, we will ease the oppressive and exhausting search.
